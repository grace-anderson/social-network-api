## Description

Book Nest is an app for book lovers, a charming community for those who love to read e-books. Readers can find a new favourite book. Book owners can share their e-books. Also, authors can share their stories with the Book Nest community.

The application was designed following the [MVC (Model View Control)](https://www.educba.com/what-is-mvc-design-pattern/) design pattern using a MySQL database with Sequelize ORM, an Express.js back end, and Handlebars templating to present data to the user.

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/grace-anderson/book-nest) for the Book Nest app's code. See the deployed app on [Heroku](https://the-book-nest.herokuapp.com/).
